  <h2>Creating a Simple IOSv Network</h2>

  <p>In this exercise you will create and connect a simple network using the IOSv node tool.&ensp; This network will be used as the basis for several of the exercises that follow.</p>

  <ol>

    <li><p>Select the IOSv node tool from the Palette.</p>

    <li><p>Drop six routers onto the Topology pane in the shape of a bow-tie, as shown.</p>

    <div class="ui icon message">
      <i class="info circle icon"></i>
      <div class="content">
        <div class="header">
          Point. Click. Escape.
        </div>
        <p>When using the node and other object tools you simply select the tool and then drop as many copies as you need, wherever you wish.&ensp; Pressing 'Escape' releases the tool.&ensp; Trying to drag and drop will only make you grumpy. </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <li><p>Click on the IOSv node in the lower-right corner, <b>pause</b>, and then click again to enable editing of the node name.</p></li><br>

    <li><p>Name the node 'Paris' and press '<b>Enter</b>' to accept the edit.</p></li><br>

    <li><p>Provide names for remaining nodes as shown below:</p>

    <div class="ui icon message">
      <i class="info circle icon"></i>
      <div class="content">
        <div class="header">
          Make things easy.
        </div>
        <p>Perhaps you're in a hurry, or feeling creative, or not prone to compliance, but these names will be used later so it might be best to just set them here. </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <li><p>Select the Connect tool from the Palette.</p>
    <img src="posts/files/virl/images/connect.png" height="35" /></li><br>

    <li><p>Click on the node named Chicago to select it as a starting point for the connection.</p></li><br>

    <li><p>Drag the tool to the node named Dallas and click to complete the connection.</p></li>

    <div class="ui icon message">
      <i class="info circle icon"></i>
      <div class="content">
        <div class="header">
          Names and Numbers.
        </div>
        <p>Observe that whenever a link between two nodes is created interface names and numbers are automatically assigned in sequential order.&ensp; For now all interfaces in VIRL are Gigabit Ethernet. </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <li><p>In the same manner, connect the remaining nodes together in the shape of a bow-tie, as shown:</p>

  </ol>
  <h3>See it done</h3>

  <h3>Summary</h3>

  <p>OK, you now have a simple network topology defined but none of the routers have any configurations.&ensp; In the next exercise you'll learn how to generate these automatically and use visualizations to explore the details of your network.</p>
