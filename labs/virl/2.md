  <h2>Introduction to VM Maestro</h2>

  <p>In this exercise you'll learn the layout and organization of VM Maestro and become familiar with the tools that are available for developing VIRL topologies.&ensp; Try to resist the urge to set off on your own for now - there's a lot to learn and we'll be building our first topology soon!</p>

  <p>To get started go to the open VM Maestro using the icon on the taskbar and take the tour that is described below:

  <h3>VMaestro Layout and Controls</h3>

  <p>VM Maestro is organized into several panes (or areas), each of which is valuable for performing an important aspect of creating, defining, and managing a VIRL topology.&ensp; These are:</p>

  <h4>The Topology Editor pane</h4>

  <p>The Topology Editor pane (or Canvas) is where you draw your topologies using objects and tools found in the Palette pane.&ensp; You can select an object from the Palette and drop one or more of that object onto the canvas.&ensp; Objects can be named, moved, or deleted from the canvas.</p>

  <p>You can also zoom in and out using the tools on the toolbar, and move around in your topology using the sliders.</p>

  <h4>The Properties Pane</h4>

  <p>The Properties pane provides a means through which the various options associated with objects in a topology (or the topology itself) can be manipulated.</p>

  <p>Depending on the object selected various tabs will appear to the left of the Properties pane which contain relevant options or provide a means to
  examine data associated with the object.&ensp; Although you may be tempted to reach an objects properties by right-clicking on it, the Properties pane is where all options can be viewed and set.</p>

  <h4>The Projects Pane</h4>

  <p>The Projects pane provides a means through which Projects (analogous to folders) and topologies can be created, managed, and deleted.&ensp; There are by default two projects, one named 'My Topologies' and another named 'Sample Topologies'. You'll be creating a new topology in the next exercise.</p>

  <h4>The Nodes and Tools Palette</h4>

  <p>The Palette pane provides a library of nodes, tools, and other objects that can be used to create VIRL topologies.</p>

  <img src="posts/files/virl/images/vmm.palette.pane.png" width="800">

  <div class="ui icon message">
    <i class="info circle icon"></i>
    <div class="content">
      <div class="header">
        Get this layout at home.
      </div>
      <p>If you want get home and want to organize your Palette pane as shown in these exercises just right-click on the Palette pane and select '<b>Layout'</b> and then '<b>Columns'</b>.&ensp; Afterwards, Select '<b>File'</b>, '<b>Preferences'</b>, '<b>Node Subtypes'</b>, '<b>Fetch from Server'</b>, and then '<b>OK'</b>.</p>

  </div>

  <h3>VMMaestro Perspectives (or Modes)</h3>

  <p>VMMaestro provides two perspectives or modes which define the layout of the various panes.&ensp; These are:</p>

  <ul>

    <li><p><b>The Design Perspective</b>: An organization of panes optimized for designing topologies - most notably through the inclusion of the Palette and Properties Panes.&ensp; This is the default perspective upon starting VM Maestro.</p></li>

    <li><p><b>The Simulation Perspective</b>: An organization of panes optimized for working with running simulations - including room for router consoles.</p></li>

  </ul>

  <p>These perspectives are selected using the two buttons named '<b>Design</b>' and '<b>Simulation</b>' in the upper-right corner of the VMMaestro window.&ensp; In either mode the panes can be moved, organized, removed, or added (via the View menu item) to suit arbitrary preferences.</p>

  <img src="posts/files/virl/images/vmm.perspectives.png" width="800">

  <div class="ui icon message">
    <i class="help circle icon"></i>
    <div class="content">
      <div class="header">
        Where did that pane go?
      </div>
      <p>If over time important panes go missing it's possible to reset both perspectives to their default layout by right-clicking on the respective tab and selecting 'Reset'.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Go ahead and click the '<b>Simulations</b>' button to activate the Simulation Perspective.</p>

  <h4>The Simulations Pane</h4>

  <p>When using the Simulation Perspective a new pane - the Simulations Pane - becomes visible.</p>

  <img src="posts/files/virl/images/vmm.simulations.pane.png" width="800"><br><br>

  <p>From the Simulations Pane you are able to manage many aspects of a simulation.&ensp; For example, you can:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><p>Connect to the consoles of one or more nodes.</p></li>
    <li><p>Stop entire simulations.</p></li>
    <li><p>Stop and restart individual nodes.</p></li>
    <li><p>View the IP addresses and ports associated with hosts and connectors.</p></li>
    <li><p>Extract configuration changes made during a simulation.</p></li>
    <li><p>Interact with simulations using an 'Active Canvas'.</p></li>
    <li><p>View live visualizations.</p></li>
  </ul>

  <p>Each of these activities will be explored in varying levels of detail in the remaining exercises.</p>

  <h4>The Consoles Pane</h4>

  <p>Below the Simulations Pane is the Consoles Pane:</p>

  <img src="posts/files/virl/images/vmm.consoles.pane.png" width="800"><br><br>

  <p>The Consoles Pane provides a number of tabs including:</p>

  <ul>

    <li><p>A VIRL systems console which provides information about the interactions between VM Maestro and the VIRL host as well as information about each of the steps taken to start, stop, and manage simulations.</p></li>

    <li><p>Consoles for nodes running in a simulation.&ensp; Whenever a console to a node is requested it will appear in a separate tab in the Consoles Pane.</p></li>

  </ul>

  <p>The Consoles Pane can be resized or maximized to provide more room for console output and activities using the familiar 'Minimize', 'Maximize', and 'Restore' tools in the corner of the pane.</p>

  <h4>Topology and Simulation Controls</h4>

  <p>The final stop in our tour of VM Maestro is the toolbar that sits just above the canvas:</p>

  <img src="posts/files/virl/images/vmm.controls.png" width="800"><br><br>

  <p>There are four main controls used in the exercises that follow. These are:</p>

  <div class="ui grid">
    <div class="one wide column"></div>
    <div class="two wide column"><img src="posts/files/virl/images/new.topology.png" height="35"></div>
    <div class="ten wide column"><b>New Topology File</b>: used to create a new topology file within an existing topology project.</div>
  </div>

  <div class="ui grid">
    <div class="one wide column"></div>
    <div class="two wide column"><img src="posts/files/virl/images/autonetkit.png" height="35"></div>
    <div class="ten wide column"><b>Build Initial Configurations</b>: used to auto-generate configurations for the nodes in the topology.&ensp; Nodes are set to receive auto-generated configurations by default but this behavior can be disabled.</div>
  </div>

  <div class="ui grid">
    <div class="one wide column"></div>
    <div class="two wide column"> <img src="posts/files/virl/images/start.sim.png" height="35"> </div>
    <div class="ten wide column"><b>Launch Simulation</b>: used to launch a simulation of the topology.</div>
  </div>

  <div class="ui grid">
    <div class="one wide column"></div>
    <div class="two wide column"><img src="posts/files/virl/images/stop.sim.png" height="35"></div>
    <div class="ten wide column"><b>Stop Simulations</b>: used to stop one or more running simulations.</div>
  </div><br>

  <h3>Summary</h3>

  <p>That's it.&ensp; You now know where all of the main VM Maestro panes and controls are.&ensp; In the exercises that follow you'll use many of these to create, configure, and manage simulated networks.</p>
