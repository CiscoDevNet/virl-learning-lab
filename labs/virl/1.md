  <h2>Getting Started with the VIRL Learning Lab</h2>

  <p></p>

  <p>Cisco Virtual Internet Routing Labs (VIRL) is an extensible network virtualization platform that enables the development of high-fidelity models of real or planned networks.&ensp; VIRL includes current virtualized versions of Cisco network operating systems and allows integration with 'real' physical / external networks, network elements, and servers.</p>

  <h2>VIRL Learning Lab Goals</h2>

  <p>The goal of this Learning Lab is to help you develop a basic level of proficiency using VM Maestro and VIRL.&ensp; Once you are familiar with VIRL you'll be able to use it to efficiently create networks, test configurations, explore features, and build testbeds against which you can develop and test SDN facilities such as APIs, programmatic interfaces, and controllers.</p>

      <p>Network programmability are not covered in this lab but there are many others available here in the DevNet Zone or on <a href="http://developer.cisco.com">DevNet</a> that do.&ensp; Be sure to check them out.</p>

  <p>In the exercises that follow you will learn many of the basics of using VM Maestro and VIRL, including how to:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><p>Navigate and use VM Maestro</p></li>
    <li><p>Create and configure a new VIRL topology file</p></li>
    <li><p>Create a simple network using IOSv nodes</p></li>
    <li><p>Generate and view network configurations and diagrams</p></li>
    <li><p>Start and connect to a VIRL simulation</p></li>
    <li><p>Explore VIRL live visualizations</p></li>
  </ul>

  <p>Upon completion of the first five exercises you'll have a good understanding of what VIRL is and how it can be used to rapidly build and interact with virtual networks for a development project.</p>

  <p>If you're interested in learning more, then a few more advanced topics are also covered, including how to:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><p>Manage VIRL configurations</p></li>
    <li><p>Configure routing protocols</p></li>
    <li><p>Use advanced simulation features</p></li>
    <li><p>Configure management access</p></li>
    <li><p>Work with VIRL node sub-types and servers</p></li>
  </ul>

  <p>Completing all of these exercises could take as long as 60 minutes if you're new to the concepts covered.&ensp; If you already have a basic understanding of VIRL you may want to start with Exercise 6.</p>

  <h3>Using Your VIRL Workspace</h3>

  <p>When you started this lab a URL will appear at the bottom of the screen.&ensp; Use this link to open a remote desktop connection to the VIRL workspace that's dedicated to your use.&ensp; Look for it now - that's where you'll do all of these exercises.</p>

  <p>You can use '<b>Alt-Tab</b>' to quickly switch between these exercises and the VIRL workspace.</p>

  <div class="ui icon message">
    <i class="refresh icon"></i>
    <div class="content">
      <div class="header">
        Start Fresh.
      </div>
      <p>Your VIRL workspace should appear with a clean desktop present and no applications open.&ensp; If for some reason yours appears otherwise use the '<b>Refresh Workspace</b>' tool on the desktop, wait a minute, then restart this lab from the Learning Labs menu.</p>
