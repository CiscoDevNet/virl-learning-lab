  <h2>Working with VIRL Simulations</h2>

	<p>In this exercise you will launch a simulation of your network topology, connect to the console of one of the simulated routers, confirm connectivity and the operation of various networking protocols, and then end the simulation.</p>

	<ol>

		<li><p>Select the '<b>Launch Simulation</b>' tool from the tool bar.</p>
		<img src="posts/files/virl/images/start.sim.png" height="30" /></li><br>

		<li><p>Depending on server load you <b>may</b> be presented with a 'Launching Simulation' window.&ensp;
		If you are, select '<b>Run in Background</b>'.</p>
		<img src="posts/files/virl/images/ml.06.run.background.png" width="400" /></li><br>

		<li><p>After the simulation is launched you will be presented with a 'Simulation Launched' window.&ensp; Select '<b>OK</b>'.</p>
		<img src="posts/files/virl/images/ml.06.sim.launched.png" width="400" /></li><br>

		<li><p>VM Maestro will switch to the Simulation perspective. Watch and wait for each of the nodes in the
		 simulation to indicate '<b>Active</b>'.</p>
		<img src="posts/files/virl/images/ml.06.sim.active.png" width="200" /></li><br>

		<li><p>Observe that while the simulation is being launched a new tab in the canvas is opened.  This '<b>Active Canvas</b>' shows the current state of each node using a 'glow'.  For example:</p>

		<ul>
			<li><p>Blue indicates that the node is starting.</p></li>
			<li><p>Green indicates that the node is active.</p></li>
			<li><p>Yellow indicates that the node is terminating.</p></li>
			<li><p>No glow indicates that the node is down.</p></li>
		</ul>

	        Node States.
	      </div>
	      <p>It's important to recognize that in this context 'active' means 'powered-on' and 'down' means 'powered-off'.&ensp; It may take several minutes for the routers (or other VIRL nodes) to actually boot to an operational state. </p>
	    </div>
	  </div>		

		<p>Observe that link states are also shown with:</p>

		<ul>
			<li><p>Dashed lines indicating a link that is down.</p></li>
			<li><p>Solid lines indicating a link that is up.</p></li>
			<li><p>Decorations on either end of the link indicating reasons for down-states, when known.</p></li>
		</ul>

		<p>We'll cover interfaces and interface states more a bit later.</p></li>

		<li><p>Right-click on the node named London and select '<b>Telnet</b>'.</p></li>
	
		<li><p>From the sub-menu select '<b>to its Console port</b>'.</p>
		<img src="posts/files/virl/images/ml.06.telnet.png" width="500" /></li><br>
	
		<li><p>Maximize the Console pane that appears in the lower-right.</p>
		<img src="posts/files/virl/images/ml.06.maximize.console.png" width="300" /></li><br>

		<li><p>Observe the IOSv boot process until you see the BGP adjacencies form.</p>
		<img src="posts/files/virl/images/ml.06.iosv.booted.png" width="700" /></li><br>

		<li><p>Press '<b>Enter</b>' to get a console prompt.</p></li><br>

		<li><p>Activate 'Enable Mode':</p>
		<div class="ui inverted message"><span class="console">en</span></div></li><br>

		<li><p>When prompted, enter the password `cisco`.</p></li><br>

		<li><p>Confirm that peers are present and CDP adjacencies have been formed:</p>
		<div class="ui inverted message"><span class="console">show cdp neighbor</span></div>
		<img src="posts/files/virl/images/ml.06.show.cdp.png" width="500" /></li><br>

		<li><p>Confirm that OSPF adjacencies have been formed:</p>
		<div class="ui inverted message"><span class="console">show ip ospf neighbor</span></div>
		<img src="posts/files/virl/images/ml.06.show.ospf.png" width="550" /></li><br>

		<li><p>Confirm that BGP neighbor relationships have been established:</p>
		<div class="ui inverted message"><span class="console">show ip bgp summary</span></div>
		<img src="posts/files/virl/images/ml.06.show.bgp.png" width="550" /></li><br>

		<li><p>Display the IP routing table and observe that routes have been learned via OSPF:</p>
		<div class="ui inverted message"><span class="console">show ip route</span></div>
		<img src="posts/files/virl/images/ml.06.show.route.png" width="550" /></li><br>

		<li><p>Select a host address from the routing table and ping it to confirm reachability to a remote router
		in the network (using 192.168.0.6 here):</p>
		<div class="ui inverted message"><span class="console">ping 192.168.0.6</span></div>
		<img src="posts/files/virl/images/ml.06.ping.png" width="550" /></li><br>

		<li><p>Exit from the console:</p>
		<div class="ui inverted message"><span class="console">exit</span></div></li><br>

		<li><p>Restore the Console pane to it's normal size and position.</p></li><br>

		<li><p>Right-click on the simulation identifier and select '<b>Stop simulation</b>'.</p>
		<img src="posts/files/virl/images/ml.06.stop.sim.png" width="300" /></li><br>

		<li><p>In the 'Stop simulation confirmation' window enable '<b>Close associated terminal views</b>'
		and then select '<b>OK</b>'.</p>
		<img src="posts/files/virl/images/ml.06.stop.conf.png" width="400" /></li><br>

		<li><p>Return to the 'Design' perspective.</p>
