  <h2>Configuring Layer-2 Switching</h2>

  <p>So far the topologies we've built have included only routers connected using point-to-point links such as might be found in wide-area deployments.&ensp; Most networks however include significant amounts of layer-2 switching with routers connected to common multi-point domains.</p>

  <p>VIRL includes two mechanism for configuring layer-2 switching.&ensp; These are:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><p>An unmanaged switch sub-type that behaves like a common Ethernet switch with a single broadcast domain.</p></li>
    <li><p>A managed IOSvL2 switch sub-type that is configured and behaves as an IOS layer-2 platform.</p></li>
  </ul>

  <p>In this exercise you will use both types of switches to create a simple OSPF network - first using a single broadcast domain so that each router forms adjacencies with all of the others, and second using VLANs on the managed IOSvL2 switch to create two broadcast domains and observing the effect this has on adjacency formation.</p>

  <ol>

    <li><p>Create a new VIRL topology using a name of your choosing.</p></li><br>

    <li><p>Select and place an '<b>Unmanaged Switch</b>' <img src="posts/files/virl/images/um.switch.png" width="25"> named '<b>Unmanaged</b>' onto the canvas.</p></li><br>

    <li><p>Select and place an '<b>IOSvL2 Switch</b>' <img src="posts/files/virl/images/iosv.l2.png" width="25"> named '<b>Managed</b>' onto the canvas directly below the 'Unmanaged' switch</p>
    <img src="posts/files/virl/images/ml.11.switches.png" width="120"></li><br>

    <li><p>Select and place six IOSv routers onto the canvas surrounding the switches.</p>
    <img src="posts/files/virl/images/ml.11.layout.png" width="280"></li><br>

    <li><p>Link 'iosv-1' and 'iosv-2' to the 'Unmanaged' switch.</p>
    <img src="posts/files/virl/images/ml.11.top.png" width="280"></li><br>

    <li><p>Link the 'Managed' switch to the remaining IOSv nodes.</p>
    <img src="posts/files/virl/images/ml.11.bottom.png" width="280"></li><br>

    <li><p>Generate configurations and launch a simulation of the new topology.</p></li><br>

    <li><p>When the simulation shows all of the nodes fully active observe that the 'Managed' switch is included as a node roster of the Simulation pane, but the 'Unmanaged' switch is not.</p></li>

        <p>The 'IOSvL2' switch is a Layer-2 capable version of IOSv and runs as a distinct node within a VIRL simulation.&ensp; An 'unmanaged' switch is quite simple in comparison and can be delivered using Linux Bridge on the VIRL host.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <li><p>Open a console connection to '<b>iosv-1</b>'.&ensp; If needed, wait until the router is fully booted.</p></li><br>

    <li><p>Observe that five OSPF adjacencies have been formed - one for each of the other IOSv routers in the simulation.</p>

    <img src="posts/files/virl/images/ml.11.five.adj.png" width="600"></li><br>

    <li><p>Open a console connection to '<b>iosv-6</b>'.</p></li><br>

    <li><p>Observe that 'iosv-6' has, like 'iosv-1' formed five OSPF adjacencies.</p></li>

      <i class="meh icon"></i>
      <div class="content">
        <p>It may be obvious to some that the number of OSPF adjacencies would be the same.&ensp;  This step is included for just for comparison, as will be seen.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <li><p>Stop the simulation, closing any open consoles and returning to the 'Design' perspective.</p></li><br>

    <li><p>Select the link connecting the 'Managed' switch and 'iosv-6'.</p></li><br>

    <li><p>In the '<b>Node Editor</b>' select the GigabitEthernet interface on '<b>iosv-6</b>'.</p>
    <img src="posts/files/virl/images/ml.11.node.editor.png" width="240"></li><br>

    <li><p>Using the '<b>AutoNetkit</b>' tab in the '<b>Properties</b>' pane, set the interface VLAN to '<b>10</b>'.</p>
    <img src="posts/files/virl/images/ml.11.vlan.png" width="600"></li><br>

    <li><p>Repeating the previous three steps place router '<b>iosv-5</b>' in VLAN 10 with 'iosv-6'.</p>

  <h3>See it done</h3>

        </div>
        <p>You've hopefully developed enough VIRL skills by now that you no longer need the animations.  In any case you won't find any from here onward.  If you get stuck just hunt down a proctor here in the DevNet Zone.</p>
      </div>
    </div></li><br>

  <h3>Summary</h3>

  <p>That's it for our foray into basic layer-2 switching.&ensp;  There is, of course, much more to IOSvL2 than VLANs, but hopefully you've gotten a taste for what's possible and now have the skills to create fairly sophisticated networks.</p>

  <p>In the next and last exercise you'll get a chance to play with some of the other VIRL sub-types.</p>
