  <h2>Managing Nodes and Interfaces in Simulations</h2>

  <p>Your network topology now contains nine IOSv nodes.&ensp; This is not a large number - even on a laptop - but if these were IOS XRv nodes or your network contained 10s or 100s of nodes you'd be in some trouble.</p>

  <p>Luckily VIRL has the ability to exclude nodes from simulations, so you can still build large topologies and test them in stages.&ensp;  You can also start and stop nodes individually to determine what effect it has on the topology or a network application.</p>

  <p>In this exercise you'll learn how to do both:</p>


  <ol>

    <li><p>Select each of the outside routers - Dallas, Chicago, Toronto, Montreal, Brussels, and Paris.</p></li><br>

    <li><p>Select the Node tab in the Properties pane.</p></li><br>

    <li><p>Set the '<b>Exclude node from simulation launch</b>' option.<p>

    <li><p>Select the Save tool <img src="posts/files/virl/images/save.png" height="18" /> to save the changes to the topology before launching.</p></li><br>

    <li><p>Launch the partial simulation of your network.</p></li><br>

    <li><p>Observe that only Halifax, London, and Paris become active.</p>
    <img src="posts/files/virl/images/ml.09.partial.png" width="700" /></li><br>

    <li><p>Open a telnet connection to London.</p></li><br>

    <li><p>Enlarge the London console tab by dragging it directly leftward so it occupies the space beneath the canvas.</p>
    <img src="posts/files/virl/images/ml.09.london.console.png" width="700" /></li>

    <div class="ui icon message">
      <i class="info circle icon"></i>
      <div class="content">
        <p>You can customize your Design and Simulation perspectives by dragging any of the panes wherever you want them just like in the step above.</p>
      </div>
    </div><br>

    <li><p>When London has fully booted use `ping` to confirm connectivity to Halifax:</p>

    <div class="ui icon message">
      <i class="find icon"></i>
      <div class="content">
        <div class="header">
         Finding Halifax.
        </div>
        <p>The VIRL Active-Canvas shows the IP addresses associated with 'Loopback0' on each router.&ensp; These are generally good choices for confirming reachability.&ensp; In the examples Halifax is '<b>192.168.0.3</b>', but your simulation may differ.</p>
      </div>
    </div><br>

    <div class="ui inverted message"><span class="console">ping 192.168.0.3</span></div><br>
    <img src="posts/files/virl/images/ml.09.halifax.up.png" width="700" />

    <div class="ui icon message">
      <i class="info circle icon"></i>
      <div class="content">
        <p>As expected Halifax is up.&ensp; But what if we were developing some new application and wanted to test how it responds to node failures?&ensp; Well, VIRL allows you to power-off routers just like you could in the real world:</p>
      </div>
    </div></li><br>

    <li><p>Right-click on Halifax and select '<b>Stop this node</b>'.</p>
    <img src="posts/files/virl/images/ml.09.halifax.stop.png" width="500" /></li><br>

    <li><p>When prompted select '<b>OK</b>' to confirm that you want to stop the node.</p></li><br>

    <li><p>Wait for Halifax to be stopped - as indicated when it loses its green 'glow'.</p></li><br>

    <div class="ui icon message">
      <i class="info circle icon"></i>
      <div class="content">
        <p>Note the difference between Halifax, which is down, and the outside nodes that have a decoration indicating that they were excluded from the simulation.</p>
      </div>
    </div><br>

    <li><p>Verify using ping that Halifax is no longer reachable.</p>
    <img src="posts/files/virl/images/ml.09.halifax.down.png" width="700" /></li><br>

    <li><p>Right-click again on Halifax and select '<b>Start this node</b>'.</p>
    <img src="posts/files/virl/images/ml.09.halifax.start.png" width="520" /></li><br>

    <li><p>Wait a few moments for Halifax to become active and boot.</p></li><br>

    <li><p>Use ping to confirm that Halifax is once again present in the network.</p>
    <img src="posts/files/virl/images/ml.09.halifax.up.again.png" width="700" /></li><br>

    <div class="ui icon message">
      <i class="power icon"></i>
      <div class="content">
        <div class="header">
         Don't feel excluded.
        </div>
        <p>So far we've been playing with the nodes that were part of the launch, but just because a node was excluded doesn't mean we can't start it later.</p>
      </div>
    </div><br>

    <li><p>Right-click on the previously excluded Brussels node and select '<b>Start this node</b>'</p>
    <img src="posts/files/virl/images/ml.09.start.brussels.png" width="560" /></li><br><br> 

    <li><p>Observe that as Brussels becomes active the link between it and London changes from dashed to solid and the '<b>?</b>' decoration disappears.</p></li><br>

    <div class="ui icon message">
      <i class="info circle icon"></i>
      <div class="content">
        <p>Now is a good time to point out that nodes aren't the only things that you can start and stop.&ensp; Interfaces too can be disabled and enabled to simulate link failures.</p>
      </div>
    </div><br>

    <li><p>Select the link that connects London to Brussels.&ensp; Observe that - once selected - the link shows 'plug' decorations on both ends.</p></li><br>

    <li><p>Right-click on the plug at the end of the link closest to Brussels and select '<b>Disable Interface</b>'</p>
    <img src="posts/files/virl/images/ml.09.disable.interface.png" width="520" /></li><br>

    <li><p>Observe that when an interface is disabled a red decoration is provided as an indicator.</b></p>
    <img src="posts/files/virl/images/ml.09.disabled.deco.png" width="520" /></li><br>

    <li><p>Right-click on the plug at the end of the link closest to Brussels and select '<b>Enable Interface</b>'</p>
    <img src="posts/files/virl/images/ml.09.enable.interface.png" width="520" /></li><br>

    <li><p>Stop the simulation and close the associated console views.</p></li><br>

    <li><p>Return to the Design perspective.</p></li><br>

  </ol>

  <h3>Summary</h3>  

  <p>Now you know how to apply a little more granularity to your launches and how to control both nodes and interfaces in running simulations.&ensp; If you're only testing specific parts of your network or you're a bit resource constrained then just launch what you need and leave the others out.</p>
