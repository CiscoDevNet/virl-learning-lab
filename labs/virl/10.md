  <h2>Configuring Management Access</h2>

  <p>We're ready now to move on from the network we've been extending so far and build some new very simple simulations that will help illustrate the management interface connectivity options available in VIRL.</p>

      <p>In order to understand and configure the various management access mechanisms you'll first need to understand some details about how VIRL handles projects, users, and networking internally.&ensp;  If you don't want to take the time for this longest of the exercises it's OK to move on to the next.</p>

       Be prepared to record some IP addresses.
      </div>
      <p>In this exercise you will need to record and reference a number of IP addresses associated with nodes in the simulations.&ensp; Be prepared to use some sort of text application to do so, or go old-school and use a pencil and paper.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>So far we've been using VM Maestro to connect to the console ports of VIRL nodes.&ensp; Console connections are useful for configuring, testing, and troubleshooting, and for many this may be all that is needed.</p>

  <p>However, what if you want to:</p>

  <ul>
      <li><p>Use a management platform for configuration.</p></li><br>
      <li><p>Send troubleshooting information to a log server.</p></li><br>
      <li><p>Download and apply updates.</p></li><br>
      <li><p>Use controllers or network applications with a network API.</p></li><br>
  </ul>

  <p>For any of these requirements you need IP connectivity to the nodes' management interfaces.&ensp; VIRL provides three mechanisms for such connectivity - these are:</p>

  <ul>
      <li><p>A Private Simulation Network.</p></li><br>
      <li><p>A Private Project Network.</p></li><br>
      <li><p>A Shared Flat Network.</p></li><br>
  </ul>

  <p>Each of these methods exposes network connectivity on the '<b>Flat</b>' network which extends from inside the VIRL host to the outside via the host's <b>eth1</b> interface.</p>

  <p>The Flat network uses by default subnet 172.16.1.0/24 and the VIRL host has an interface on Flat at 172.16.1.254.&ensp; The Flat IP subnet, host interface, and host IP address can each be changed during installation to suit site-specific requirements, but this exercise assumes that the defaults remain in use.</p>

  <p>These three mechanisms - described below - are chosen using the Management Network drop-down on the Topology tab of the topology's Properties pane:</p>

  <h4>Private Simulation and Private Project Networking</h4>

  <p>Whenever either of the Private methods are used a Linux Container (LXC) or - optionally - an Ubuntu jump-host is created for each simulation to provide a bridge (a figurative bridge, not literal networking bridge) between the Flat network and a management network which uses subnet 10.255.0.0/16 by default, and into which each nodes' management interface is placed.</p>

  <p>Management access is then achieved by first accessing the LXC using SSH, and then using Telnet or SSH from the LXC to access the nodes.&ensp; The LXC can also be configured to forward traffic for nodes in the simulation or even host network applications or services directly to manage the nodes in the simulation.</p>

       Jump host?
      </div>
      <p>A Jump Host is simply a system that has interfaces in two networks, one of which you can reach and the other of which you cannot, except by using the host as a way-point.&ensp; VIRL provides two Jump Host mechanisms - a lightweight LXC and a heavier full Ubuntu virtual machine which can be modified to provide persistent services and applications if needed.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h5>Projects and Users</h5>

  <p>Before further explanation of the differences between Private Simulation and Private Project Networking can be offered it's important that you understand the distinction between Projects and Users.</p>

  <p>A project is a group of users, and every user must be in a project.&ensp; By default the user 'guest' is created and used when initially connecting VM Maestro to the VIRL server.&ensp; What's perhaps not apparent is that this user 'guest' is already part of a project of the same name.</p>

  <p>Using the VIRL <b>User Workspace Management</b> interface it's possible to create additional projects, and additional users within projects.&ensp; For example, we could create users 'jack' and 'jill' in the 'guest' project and when accessing VIRL from VM Maestro the credentials used would be 'guest-jack' and 'guest-jill', making both the project and the user names apparent.</p>

  <p>We could also create new projects called 'dev' or 'ops', and distinct users within each (but we aren't going to).</p>

  <p>Now that you understand 'projects' and 'users', let's explore the primary differences between the two Private methods - that being the scope of visibility provided by the LXC.</p>

  <h5>Private Simulation Networking</h5>

  <p>When using Private Simulation Networking a single discrete 10.255.0.0/16 subnet is created <b>for each simulation</b> and the accompanying LXC has connectivity to only those nodes running within that single simulation, as illustrated below.&ensp;  The dotted line represents the scope of nodes visible to the LXC:</p>

  <img src="posts/files/virl/images/ml.10.psn.png" width="600" /><br><br>

  <p>The LXC cannot see and therefore cannot access the nodes in any other simulations, even those running as part of the same project.</p>

  <h5>Private Project Networking</h5>

  <p>When using Private Project Networking a single discrete 10.255.0.0/16 subnet is created <b>for the project</b> and the LXCs accompanying each simulation each have connectivity to all nodes running within that project, regardless of which user owns the simulation, as illustrated below.&ensp; The dotted line represents the scope of nodes visible to the LXC:</p>

  <img src="posts/files/virl/images/ml.10.ppn.png" width="600" /><br><br>

  <p>The LXCs cannot see and therefore cannot access the nodes in any other project or the nodes that are part of any simulations - even those in the same project - that use Private Simulation Networking.</p>

  <h4>Shared Flat Networking</h4>

  <p>The Shared Flat Networking mechanism differs from the two Private mechanisms in a number of key ways:</p>

  <ul>
      <li><p>The management interfaces of the nodes in a simulation are placed directly on the Flat (172.16.1.0/24) network.</p></li><br>
      <li><p>No 10.255.0.0/16 subnets are created, nor are any LXCs used or needed for management access.</p></li><br>
      <li><p>Nodes have visibility to all other nodes in simulations using Shared Flat Networking, regardless project or user.</p></li><br>
      <li><p>Nodes have visibility to all LXCs associated with other simulations regardless project or user.</p></li><br>
      <li><p>Nodes have direct connectivity to all devices on the Flat network, including the VIRL host and devices accessible via 'eth1'.</p></li><br>
  </ul>

  <img src="posts/files/virl/images/ml.10.sfn.png" width="600" /><br>

  <h4>Onward to the Lab</h4>

  <p>OK, now that you understand the differences between the three management access mechanisms let's move on to the lab.</p>

  <p>In this exercise you will create four new topologies containing a single router each and using each of the management network mechanisms described above.&ensp;  You will then access the VIRL host directly so as to gain access to the Flat network and examine the reachabilty that exists between the nodes in the four simulations.</p>

       You've got this.
      </div>
      <p>Steps you've done already won't be described in as much detail below.  Just take your time and use what you've learned so far.&ensp; If you get stuck just go back and review the previous exercises.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <ol>

    <li><p>Create and launch four new VIRL topologies each containing <b>a single IOSv router</b> and configured as follows:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>First topology: named '<b>Lab.09.private.virl</b>' using '<b>Private Simulation Network</b>' for management.</p></li><br>
      <li><p>Second topology: named '<b>Lab.09.project.1.virl</b>' using '<b>Private Project Network</b>' for management.</p></li><br>
      <li><p>Third topology: named '<b>Lab.09.project.2.virl</b>' using '<b>Private Project Network</b>' for management.</p></li><br>
      <li><p>Fourth topology: named '<b>Lab.09.shared.virl</b>' using '<b>Shared Flat Network</b>' for management.</p></li><br>
    </ul><p></p>

    <p>Don't forget to generate configurations for each of your topologies, and just so they are more easily recognized in the steps below you may want to name your routers to match the topology to which they belong.</p></li><br>

    <li><p>Using the Simulations pane, identify and record the IP address associated with the IOSv node in the '<b>private</b>' simulation:</p>

    <ol>
      <li><p>Right-click on the node.</p></li>
      <li><p>Select '<b>Telnet...</b>'</p></li>
      <li><p>Look for the address associated with the '<b>Management</b>' port.</p></li>
    </ol><p></p>

    <p>In this example the management IP address associated with the IOSv node in the '<b>private</b>' simulation is '<b>10.255.0.1</b>.'</p>

    <li><p>Identify and record the IP address associated with the LXC created for the '<b>private</b>' simulation.&ensp; In this example the LXC's IP address is '<b>172.16.1.114</b>.'</p>

    <img src="posts/files/virl/images/ml.10.lxc.ip.png" width="400" /></li><br>

    <li><p>In the same manner record the IP addresses associated with the IOSv nodes and LXCs in the '<b>project.1</b>' and '<b>project.2</b>' simulations.</p></li><br>

    <li><p>Record the management IP address for IOSv node in the <b>'shared</b>' simulation.&ensp; In this example the IOSv node's management IP address is '<b>172.16.1.117</b>'</p>

        <p>Observe that the management IP address for the IOSv node in the 'shared' simulation is on the Flat subnet just like the LXCs associated with the 'private' simulations.&ensp; Because of this no LXC is needed to gain management access.&ensp; LXCs are still created for 'shared' simulations, but they are used for other purposes such as configuration extraction and can be ignored here.</p>

          <p>We've captured the IP addresses we need in each of the four simulations and now need access to the Flat subnet so we can connect to the various LXCs and IOSv nodes.</p>

          <p>There are a number of ways to get access to the Flat subnet, but the one way that works every time for everyone is to login to the VIRL host and use its permanent and direct interface into Flat.</p>
      </div>
    </div></li>

    <li><p>Find the IP address of your VIRL host.&ensp;  This is most easily accomplished using the '<b>Credentials Tool</b>' in the bottom right of the VM Maestro Status bar. Select the button that appears as:</p>
    <img src="posts/files/virl/images/ml.10.credentials.png" width="100" /><p></p>

    <p>Then find the IP address or host name listed in the roster.&ensp; In this example, the IP address of the VIRL host is '<b>10.1.1.138</b>' but <span style="color:darkred">your address may differ.</span></p>

    <img src="posts/files/virl/images/ml.10.virl.ip.png" width="500" /></li><br>

    <li><p>Using an SSH tool appropriate to your platform connect to the VIRL host using the username '<b>virl</b>' and password '<b>VIRL</b>'.&ensp; For example <span style="color:darkred">(your address may differ)</span>:</p>

    <p>On a Mac or Linux open a Terminal window and enter:</p>
    <div class="ui inverted message"><span class="console">ssh virl@10.1.138</span></div></p>

  <p>You should now have a good understanding of a number of important VIRL new concepts, including:</p>

  <ul>

    <li><p>How to access management interfaces on nodes running in VIRL simulations.</p></li><br>
    <li><p>How the management networks associated with simulations can be isolated from, or shared with, other simulations.</p></li><br>
    <li><p>How using the 'shared' management mechanism can enable direct but broad connectivity to nodes running in VIRL simulations.</p></li><br>
    <li><p>How access to the Flat subnet can be achieved using the VIRL host or in some cases directly.</p></li><br>
  </ul>

  <p>Now let's move on to the next exercise where you'll learn how to use some of the layer-2 features available in VIRL.</p>
