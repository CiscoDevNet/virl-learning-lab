  <h2>Building Configurations and Visualizations</h2>

  <p>In this exercise you will use the VIRL AutoNetKit facility to generate configurations for each router and examine  visualizations that describe key aspects of your topology.</p>

  <div class="ui icon message">
    <i class="help circle icon"></i>
    <div class="content">
      <div class="header">
        Configure painlessly.
      </div>
      <p>At this point you've defined the router types, number, and connections, but not much else.&ensp; A bevy of defaults will be used by AutoNetKit to generate configurations for now but you'll learn how to adjust these later.&ensp; This is very useful for getting a network up and running with basic connectivity. </p>

  <ol>

    <li><p>Select the '<b>Build Initial Configurations</b>' tool from the toolbar.</p>

    <li><p>When prompted to see the router configuration changes select '<b>Yes</b>'.</p>

    <li><p>Use the slider to view the configurations that were generated for each node in the topology.</p>

        <div class="header">
          Configuration Comparisons.
        </div>
        <p>The configuration comparisons window provides a view of the full topology definition file in XML before and after the Build Configurations Tool was used.&ensp; Before is on the left and after is on the right.&ensp; Since no configurations existed before we now see them added in full for each router.&ensp; Subsequent uses will only show discrete configuration changes. </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <li><p>Select '<b>OK</b>' to close the comparison window.</p></li>

    <li><p>When prompted to see the AutoNetKit visualizations select '<b>Yes</b>'.</p>

    <div class="ui icon message">
      <i class="info circle icon"></i>
      <div class="content">
        The visualizations will appear in a browser window that opens automatically.
      </div>
    </div>

    <li><p>Use the view selector in the upper-left corner to select from the many visualizations created by AutoNetKit.&ensp; Spend some time here to see all that's available.</p>

    <b>Initial View and Menu</b><br>

    <b>IPv4 View with Details</b><br>

    <p>When you hover over objects such as nodes and links details about that object are provided.</p>
    <img src="posts/files/virl/images/ml.05.ank.ipv4.png" width="600" /></li>

    <div class="ui icon message">

      <div class="content">
        <div class="header">
          Visualize.
        </div>
        <p>Your topology is not very complex yet so the visualizations are a bit boring.&ensp; However, as topologies become more complex the visualizations become extremely useful for ensuring that your network is configured the way you intended and for spotting configuration mishaps.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

  <li><p>When finished exploring close the browser window and return to VM Maestro.</p></li>
  <li><p>Observe that after configurations have been generated for your nodes their labels include the assigned IPv4 and IPv6 looback addresses.</p></li>

  </ol>

  <h3>Summary</h3>

  <p>You've now defined your network and each of the routers has a starting configuration.&ensp; In the next exercise you'll bring your network to life.</p>
